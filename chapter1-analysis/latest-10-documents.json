        "content": "Problem P6 explores propagation delay and transmission delay between two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link. Here is the full problem statement:\n\n**P6.** This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmission delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate R bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by m meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is s meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size L bits to Host B.\n\na. Express the propagation delay, dprop, in terms of m and s.\n\nb. Determine the transmission time of the packet, dtrans, in terms of L and R.\n\nc. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.\n\nd. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t = 0. At time t = dtrans, where is the last bit of the packet?\n\ne. Suppose dprop is greater than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet?\n\nf. Suppose dprop is less than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet?\n\ng. Suppose s = 2.5 × 10^8, L = 1500 bytes, and R = 10 Mbps. Find the distance m so that dprop equals dtrans.\n\nWould you like to explore one of these sub-problems step by step? If so, which part would you like to tackle first?",
