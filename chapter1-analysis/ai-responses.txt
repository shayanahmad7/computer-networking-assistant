Problem P6 from the chapter is as follows:

**P6.** This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmission delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate R bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by m meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is s meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size L bits to Host B.

a. Express the propagation delay, \(d_{\text{prop}}\), in terms of \(m\) and \(s\).

b. Determine the transmission time of the packet, \(d_{\text{trans}}\), in terms of \(L\) and \(R\).

c. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.

d. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time \(t = 0\). At time \(t = d_{\text{trans}}\), where is the last bit of the packet?

e. Suppose \(d_{\text{prop}}\) is greater than \(d_{\text{trans}}\). At time \(t = d_{\text{trans}}\), where is the first bit of the packet?

f. Suppose \(d_{\text{prop}}\) is less than \(d_{\text{trans}}\). At time \(t = d_{\text{trans}}\), where is the first bit of the packet?

g. Suppose \(s = 2.5 \times 10^8\), \(L = 1500\) bytes, and \(R = 10\) Mbps. Find the distance \(m\) so that \(d_{\text{prop}}\) equals \(d_{\text{trans}}\).

g. Suppose \(s = 2.5 \times 10^8\), \(L = 1500\) bytes, and \(R = 10\) Mbps. Find the distance \(m\) so that \(d_{prop}\) equals \(d_{trans}\).

### Let's start with part (a):
**(a)** Express the propagation delay, \(d_{prop}\), in terms of \(m\) and \(s\).

### Hint:
The propagation delay can be calculated with the formula:
\[
d_{prop} = \frac{m}{s}
\]

Do you want to proceed with this calculation, or would you like to discuss another part of the problem?

Problem P6 involves exploring two important concepts in data networking: propagation delay and transmission delay. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

**Problem P6:**
Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate \( R \) bps. The two hosts are separated by \( m \) meters, and the propagation speed along the link is \( s \) meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size \( L \) bits to Host B.

2. **(b)** Determine the transmission time of the packet, \( d_{\text{trans}} \), in terms of \( L \) and \( R \).
3. **(c)** Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.
4. **(d)** If Host A begins to transmit the packet at time \( t = 0 \), where is the last bit of the packet at time \( t = d_{\text{trans}} \)?
5. **(e)** If \( d_{\text{prop}} \) is greater than \( d_{\text{trans}} \), where is the first bit of the packet at time \( t = d_{\text{trans}} \)?
6. **(f)** If \( d_{\text{prop}} \) is less than \( d_{\text{trans}} \), where is the first bit of the packet at time \( t = d_{\text{trans}} \)?
7. **(g)** Suppose \( s = 2.5 \times 10^8 \), \( L = 1500 \) bytes, and \( R = 10 \) Mbps. Find the distance \( m \) so that \( d_{\text{prop}} \) equals \( d_{\text{trans}} \).
